    <p><strong>ðŸ”¹Geography of MaharashtraðŸ”¹</strong></p> Maharashtra is located in the northern center of peninsular India,surrounded
        by the Arabian sea in the west,Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh on the north,Madhya Pradesh in the east and Karnataka
        and Andhra Pradesh on the south.As far as the geography of Maharashtra goes, much of the state consists of the high Deccan plateau,
        which is separated from the straight Konkan coastline by 'Ghats'.The Ghats are a succession of steep hills,
        periodically bisected by narrow roads,
        and which are often crowned by medieval forts. Given their altitude, it is not surprising that the Ghats are home to the state's hill stations.
        One of the three major regions of the state is the Sahyadri range with an elevation of 1000 meters.</p>
